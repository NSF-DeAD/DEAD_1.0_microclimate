DEAD_Kestrel_data_compile.qmd: 
Written by Heather Throop, last updated Feb 8, 2025
This code pulls together the csv files from ~55 different dataloggers, 
each of which was downloaded ~5 times. This takes the L0 (raw) data, combines into an L1 file, cleans redundant data 
(e.g., multiple instances of the same time point in different files), removes logs before or after loggers were 
deployed, and adds meta-data (site, microsite) for each logger. An L2 file is created and stored as output in Dropbox. 
Plots for RH and temperature for each logger are generated. 
Note that Moab logger 2605760 seems to be missing logs at the start of the time period. I wasn't able to track down where they 
get dropped. It is possible that there are similar issues with other loggers.

Note that this was updated before overhauling the DEAD_Kestrel_data_compile. I haven't had a chance to go back 
and update it. Use with caution.
